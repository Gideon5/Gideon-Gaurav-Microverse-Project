    Hello Camper!

    For now, the test suite only works in Chrome!
    Please read the README below in the JS Editor before beginning.
    Feel free to delete this message once you have read it.
    Good luck and Happy Coding!

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="What_you_should_already_know">What you should already know</header>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
          </li>
        </ul>
        
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="Javascript_and_Java">JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        <p>Hello JavaScript</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript is case sensitive</li>
          <li>There are some predefined function in JavaScript</li>
          <li>Javascript is user friendly</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="Hello_World">Hello world</header>
        <article>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code>
            "function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName);}
            greetMe("World");"
          </code>

        Select the code in the pad  and hit Ctrl +R to watch it unfold in your browser!
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="Variables">Variables</header>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="Variable_Scope">Variable Scope</header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <p>avaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
